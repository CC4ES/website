        <p class="text-xl">
          Sustainability starts at the individual level. Food systems are the
          basis of securing environmental, social and economic sustainability.
          Growing our own food is the most direct means of addressing food
          insecurity and cultivating a healthy lifestyle. Sustainable food
          system promotes food-waste reduction, which also improves
          environmental health.

          Citizen scientist programs empower community members to improve their
          environmental health necessary for the well-being of the whole
          community, nurturing environmental stewardship in the long run.

          Living things in nature regenerate â€” regrow themselves. Regenerative
          approaches work by mimicking nature. Examples include incorporating
          sustainable designs for gardening/farming, design architecture and
          landscape, transportation, and more. All these define emerging green
          job descriptions.

          Installing energy efficient lighting, storm water mitigation and
          implement water conservation techniques. Decreasing waste, composting,
          and recycling, repairing and sharing tools and equipment instead of
          purchasing new ones are sustainable practices that can evolve into
          entrepreneurship, creating businesses and jobs in local communities.
          And jobs keep them stay in communities.
