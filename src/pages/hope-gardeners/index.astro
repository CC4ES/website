          Growing our own food is the simplest and most direct action for
          sustainability. CC4ES implements outreach education on gardening at a
          grassroots level. CC4ES Hope Gardeners convenes school and community
          gardeners of any shape and size to share resources and support.
          Gardening promotes environmental stewardship that improves
          environmental health for the whole community. Gardens provide a
          platform that embraces and celebrates diversity, building communities
          sustainable and resilient with environmental, economic and social
          equity and justice.
