              Ever-emerging environmental, social and economic challenges
              necessitate a lifestyle that fosters sustainability. Cultivating
              sustainable lifestyles entails continual learning and diligent
              practices. Such endeavor resonates with the CC4ES core tenets:
              comprehensive collaboration for systemic change, community-based
              motivation and empowerment, and establishing an environment for
              lifelong learning and practice.

              Food is a universal human right. As food is embedded in
              socio-cultural systems, food justice is environmental, social and
              economic justice. Growing one's own food provides the most
              impactful means of ensuring environmental, social and economic
              sustainability. CC4ES uses growing one's own food as a grassroots
              community mobilizer to platform the collective shifts necessary
              for cultivating community-narrated and community-empowered
              regenerative sustainability.

              CC4ES classifies the complexity of sustainability into six
              modules. Although all six modules are interconnected, the
              Environmental Justice & Diversity module underpins all others.
              Environmental justice is social justice. Sustainability is only
              possible in a society that champions justice and equity.
