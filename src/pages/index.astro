            Ever-emerging environmental, social and economic challenges
            necessitate a lifestyle that fosters sustainability. Cultivating
            sustainable lifestyles entails continual learning and diligent
            practices. Such endeavor resonates with the CC4ES core tenets:
            comprehensive collaboration for systemic change, community-based
            motivation and empowerment, and establishing an environment for
            lifelong learning and practice.

            Food is a universal human right. As food is embedded in
            socio-cultural systems, food justice is environmental, social and
            economic justice. Growing one's own food provides the most impactful
            means of ensuring environmental, social and economic sustainability.
            CC4ES uses growing one's own food as a grassroots community
            mobilizer to platform the collective shifts necessary for
            cultivating community-narrated and community-empowered regenerative
            sustainability.

              Rhody Grows Hope (RGH) is a container gardening program that
              repurposes food plastic recyclables - such as 32-oz yogurt
              containers and salad containers - as planters to grow food while
              reducing plastic waste. RGH also repurposes heat-treated pallets
              as raised garden beds. <br /><br />RGH circumvents soil
              contamination and limited or no land access prevalent in frontline
              communities, for food security, sovereignty and justice. <br /><br
              />Every $20 provides a RGH garden to help a family in need.

            CC4ES classifies the complexity of sustainability into six modules.
            Although all six modules are interconnected, the Environmental
            Justice & Diversity module underpins all others. Environmental
            justice is social justice. Sustainability is only possible in a
            society that champions justice and equity.
