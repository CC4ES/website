    <SectionHeading>Why We Need Trees</SectionHeading>

        Trees are a vital part of our world, and crucial to our survival.
      </h5>
      <p>
        Tree provide us with the oxygen we need to breathe, shelter for
        wildlife, and food to eat. And there is so much more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are 10 reasons why trees should be a staple in our landscaping.
      </p>
      <ol class="list-decimal list-inside space-y-4">
        <li>
          Trees increase property values. landscaping with trees and plants can
          increase property value by as much as 20% -- a great return on
          investment in terms of the small amount of upkeep trees require.
        </li>
        <li>
          Trees clean the air. A tree can absorb as much as 48 pounds of carbon
          dioxide each year and can sequester 1 ton of carbon dioxide by the
          time it reaches 40 years old. In addition, trees absorb odors and
          pollutant gases such as nitrogen oxides, ammonia, sulfur dioxide and
          ozone, and filter particulates out of the air by trapping them on
          their leaves and bark.
        </li>
        <li>
          Trees slow water runoff. Flash flooding can be significantly reduced
          by planting trees. According to About.com, a Colorado Blue Spruce,
          either planted or growing wild, can intercept more than 1,000 gallons
          of water annually when fully grown, which helps recharge underground
          aquifers.
        </li>
        <li>
          Trees prevent soil erosion. A tree's root system binds the soil and
          its leaves provide a barrier to the wind and rain; thus preventing
          soil erosion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Trees help buffer noise pollution. Trees that are planted at strategic
          points in a neighborhood or around your house can abate major noises.
          This is especially nice if you live near a freeway or airport.
        </li>
        <li>
          Trees cool our homes, streets, and cities. Trees can cool a city by up
          to 10° Fahrenheit by shading homes and streets, breaking up urban
          “heat islands”, and releasing water vapor into the air through their
          leaves.
        </li>
        <li>
          Trees can save you money on energy costs. Building off the previous
          point, strategically placed trees can save homeowners up to 25 percent
          on energy bills by providing shade in the summer and windbreaks in the
          winter.
        </li>
        <li>
          Trees are beautiful. This is a no-brainer. Trees are stunning parts of
          our natural landscape. From the first buds of spring to the colorful
          leaves in the fall, trees are gorgeous. They make a great decoration
          indoors or outdoors.
        </li>
        <li>
          Trees are sacred. Trees were sacred to many ancient worlds, and still
          hold special meaning in many cultures today. The Druids believed a
          number of trees to be sacred, including the Ash tree from which
          healing wands were made. Today, many people in Madagascar worship them
          because they believe their ancestor's spirits live in the forests.
        </li>
        <li>
          Medicines are derived from trees (and plants). Did you know that
          aspirin was derived from willow bark? Or that dogwood bark has been
          used as a substitute for quinine? While many drugs that come from
          plants and trees have been replaced by synthetics, there is no denying
          how important they are when it comes to modern medicine and research.
