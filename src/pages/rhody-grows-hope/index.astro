        Growing one's own food provides the most direct impactful means of
        ensuring environmental, social and economic sustainability: one small
        container garden initiates a comprehensive integration of food paths
        from growing food, cooking nutritious food, reducing food waste,
        composting, green entrepreneurship, and environmental stewardship
        essential for cultivating regenerative sustainability.

      <p class="text-xl">
        Rhody Grows Hope encompasses various CC4ES projects the common thread of
        which is growing one's own food at the community grassroots level:
        Museum of Silenced Histories & Gardens of Regeneration, Youths for Urban
        Sustainability, and CC4ES Direct through Hope Gardeners network
        platform.
      </p>
      <p class="text-xl">
        Size-scalability and mobile nature of container gardening is ideal for
        tending to the communities at grassroots level - especially, frontline
        communities' brunt with environmental challenges in addition to food
        apartheid. Gardening in a container circumvents the soil contamination
        challenges of brownfield prevalent in these communities. Mobility nature
        troubleshoots maintenance challenges that most school gardens face:
        students can take the container gardens home when schools are not in
        session. Furthermore, they can educate their family on growing one's own
        food, nurturing their leadership, engaging and empowering the whole
        community.
