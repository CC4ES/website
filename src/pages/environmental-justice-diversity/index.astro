            Facing Our Own Implicit Biases
          </h3>
          <p>
            Implicit bias is an unconscious bias. Whether we want to admit it or
            not, we all have implicit biases. Unfortunately, most of us do not
            realize when we are influenced by our own biases, especially those
            involving race and gender. Civil rights movements and policies have
            made explicit biases, such as racial and gender discrimination,
            socially unacceptable and illegal, yet they are still pervasive.

              <em>The New Jim Crow</em> by Michelle Alexander explores systemic implicit
              racism and shows how it is not isolated to white people. There are
              many people of color who are unknowingly or even intentionally racist.
              “White” is not the color of skin, it is an attitude based on our own
              paradigms — the very reason we need to start this important exploration
              from within ourselves.

          <p>
            Do you have a place of identity where you can establish
            relationships and cultivate your own values and beliefs? A place of
            identity could be your home, school, business, community. What if
            you were displaced from or denied access to such a place? We need to
            understand our history. Only then, can we move forward to achieve an
            environmentally and socially just society. The 1619 Project is a
            documentary podcast about 400 years of Black American slavery. It
            sheds light on the systemic magnitude of racism — basically for the
            profit of cotton industries. The video below, “Why All Americans
            Should Care About ‘Environmental Racism?” shows how Indigenous
            people were displaced from their own ancestors' land. It is a good
            representation of why environmental and social justice is necessary
            to address the current issues we face.

            Racism & Environment: Redlining & The Green Ceiling
          </h3>
          <p>
            Environmental movements and implicit racism have a long parallel
            history. Redlining is an ongoing process that associates people of
            color with inner-city urban communities with limited public access
            to nature. Decades ago, the 12-16% green ceiling was set for people
            of color communities to be represented in any environmental
            organizations. People of color make up 36% of the U.S. population
            and 29% of the science and engineering workforce, yet the green
            ceiling has not be broken. In order for us to achieve environmental
            justice, we need to tackle systemic racism.
