        <p>
          Many of the resources and approaches that are shared with you are the
          extension of lessons I have created and taught in college courses,
          including environmental science, economics and chemistry. Two
          observations that compelled me to create CC4ES: (1) Perceptual change
          — we need to change our perception for tackling environmental issues.
          We have all of the necessary data and information, we need to put it
          into action, (2) Internal motivation — we all need to change
          individually for collective momentum. Social science research and
          studies confirm that simply sharing data and information through
          outreach education do not necessarily lead to long-term behavioral
          change. So, CC4ES uses experiential learning, which is the most
          effective means of retaining knowledge. With consistent cultivation,
          our knowledge becomes wisdom. Practical applications suggested are
          from my own experiential learning as a Master Gardener, and my daily
          practice of mindful consumption and minimalism.

          A platform to bridge academia and the general public
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          Academic scientific research provides very important information, but
          it needs to be framed in a language that the public can understand and
          relate to. CC4ES filters information/data in its six modules, and
          translates it into more basic language, using digital resources as
          reference.

          Personal reflection: start a journal for this journey
        </h3>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          Keeping a personal journal has become a must in my classes. Most of my
          students appreciate how it positively affects them and helps them
          handle challenges beyond the classroom. So start yours, and see how it
          works out for you.

      <div>
        <p>
          The resources posted, and comments shared are based on my own personal
          readings, and take-away from workshops/programs and events. This holds
          the same for CC4ES team members. These resources are selected for six
          module categories, after science-based credence verification. If you
          have other resources and information you would like to share, please
          contact us.

      </div>
      <div>
        <p>
          We did our best to keep the resources organized in a consistent
          structure for each of the six modules. As shown in the systemic map
          below, these six modules cover different facets of our lifestyle, yet,
          they are all interconnected. The Environmental Justice &amp; Diversity
          module underpins all of the others. It is important to explore our own
          personal paradigms which influence our perception of the world. The
          resources comprise of links to pertinent articles, books, videos, and
          podcasts; there are questions that will hopefully help you reflect on
          your personal journey; keywords for further exploration; DIY
          activities, how to start a garden, and yes, most importantly
          sustainable living. CC4ES Maps provide both conceptional and
          geographical maps depending on the module. It is always a work in
          process due to the dynamic nature of the material. Again, please share
          any thoughts you think may help us with this journey. We welcome and
          appreciate your participation and sharing.
