            Living systems are regenerative, they renew themselves.&nbsp;
            According to this definition, all natural resources should be
            renewable. However, since their renewable rates for human lifespan
            and consumption rate&nbsp;<span>are too long</span><span
              >, most of our resources are finite.&nbsp; To counter this
              challenge, regenerative technologies are emerging in various
              contexts — <b>permaculture for agriculture</b> — the term “permaculture”
              originates from the combination of permanent and agriculture; <b
                >renewable energy technologies</b
              > include solar, wind, biomass, tidal, and hydrodynamic; <b
                >energy efficient transportation</b
              >&nbsp;— hybrid, electric cars, high-speed trains, solar-powered
              cargo ships and trucks, solar powered floating airplane runways,
              and more.&nbsp; Although these broader contexts are critical to
              success, we must not discount the impact that each of our actions
              has on the world around us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span

              Permaculture is one of many ways to regenerate resources.&nbsp;
              Its core principle of working with, not against nature, resonates
              with all other regenerative technologies.&nbsp;&nbsp;

            its elements to achieve the sustainability that intersects the 3P’s
            — people, planet and profit (or prosperity). There are different
            strategies for different uses of the building. Regardless of the way
            in which the building/space is used, the final goal or outcome of
            the green building is sustainability.

          Checks and Balances for Now and the Future
        </h3>
        <p class="text-left">
          All renewable technologies come with pros and cons. We have to
          consider the long term consequences and environmental impact in terms
          of mitigating climate change. For example, what is the trade-off as we
          clear forests and farmland to build solar farms? This same
          controversial question should be asked of the accelerating advance of
          renewable technologies. The two videos below present different sides
          of the argument. The perception that technology will save us must not
          go unchecked while we can adjust our lifestyles and businesses to
          conserve energy.
