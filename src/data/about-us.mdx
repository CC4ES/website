    bioText: |
      Susan is a perpetual learner and a quintessential educator with 30 plus years of teaching, mostly in universities. Her pursuit in interdisciplinary teaching in a diverse range ofdemographics started with her life-defining experiences as a 15 year-old Korean immigrant in Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York.  This gave rise, in her adult life, to a specific focus on frontline communities and a passion for, and commitment to building a community-narrated and empowered sustainable and regenerative society that champions environmental, economic and social justice and equity. 

      Susan founded the Coalition Center for Environmental Sustainability/CC4ES, based on the core tenets from her consistent practice as a perpetual learner: a holistic approach, internal motivation, and building a network environment for lifelong learning. CC4ES was founded to serve as an interface bridging information and resource gaps between policy makers and communities in need. Through both her teaching and her community-based work, Susan works to develop strong engagement between academia and surrounding communities through process of outreach education, and spearheading opportunities for universities to collaborate with policy makers and businesses in supporting community-focused economic development. 

      Having volunteered as a Master Gardener to oversee the Providence schools under the URI Cooperative Extension School Garden Initiative program, Susan created the Hope Gardeners, a comprehensive gardeners network platform to complement its mission and to expand its outreach to community gardeners and college campus gardeners. Hope Gardeners provides an integral collaboration forum necessary for all CC4ES programs.

      She launched Rhody Grows Hope, a container gardening project that uses growing one's own food as a grassroots community mobilizer for food security, sovereignty and justice. Rhody Grows Hope project encompasses various CC4ES projects whose common thread is gardening: Museum of Silenced Histories & Gardens of Regeneration, Youths for Urban Sustainability program for Rhody Greeneers, and CC4ES Direct all through Hope Gardeners network platform. They reflect Susan's belief food justice is a gateway to environmental, social and economic justice, and resonate with her commitment to and passion for cultivating communities that honor and value justice and equity. 

      Susan holds B.S.and M.S.in chemistry and a dual ABD in chemistry and education system designs with focus on innercity communities and their schools, and a Ph.D. in environmental and natural resource economics.

      Diana Ferreira began her trajectory in the education sector over 7 years ago after being in the costume jewelry industry for almost 20 years. She is a daughter, partner, mother and grandmother to some of the most amazing human beings on this planet, immigrating to Rhode Island at a young age from Colombia, South America.

      Diana believes in the importance and value of raising not only academically bright, but also kind, respectful, socially conscious and responsible children in this world. She considers herself a fierce advocate for those that may be faced with the English language as a barrier, or just lack of knowledge to help themselves or their families succeed and have as many choices and opportunities the world has to offer. She sees the need for more people to work towards a goal where everyone has equitable opportunities to reach their highest potential and become contributing members of our communities and beyond. Which is why working in education is a pathway to reach many that need it most in the hopes of making an impact on their lives.

      Diana worked in public education for seven years and is passionate about helping bridge the language barrier for Spanish-speaking Rhode Islanders and beyond to promote knowledge, information, and education in various topics and on various levels to promote informed decisions and more active participation, leading to positive change for underserved minority populations.  Joining the Coalition Center for Environmental Sustainability was an easy decision because CC4ES brings a wealth of knowledge and education that can only further catapult the impact she is trying to make in her community.
