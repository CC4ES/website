    bioText: |
      Susan is a perpetual learner and a quintessential educator with 30 plus years of teaching, mostly in universities. Her pursuit in interdisciplinary teaching in a diverse range ofdemographics started with her life-defining experiences as a 15 year-old Korean immigrant in Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York.  This gave rise, in her adult life, to a specific focus on frontline communities and a passion for, and commitment to building a community-narrated and empowered sustainable and regenerative society that champions environmental, economic and social justice and equity. 

      Susan founded the Coalition Center for Environmental Sustainability/CC4ES, based on the core tenets from her consistent practice as a perpetual learner: a holistic approach, internal motivation, and building a network environment for lifelong learning. CC4ES was founded to serve as an interface bridging information and resource gaps between policy makers and communities in need. Through both her teaching and her community-based work, Susan works to develop strong engagement between academia and surrounding communities through process of outreach education, and spearheading opportunities for universities to collaborate with policy makers and businesses in supporting community-focused economic development. 

      Having volunteered as a Master Gardener to oversee the Providence schools under the URI Cooperative Extension School Garden Initiative program, Susan created the Hope Gardeners, a comprehensive gardeners network platform to complement its mission and to expand its outreach to community gardeners and college campus gardeners. Hope Gardeners provides an integral collaboration forum necessary for all CC4ES programs.

      She launched Rhody Grows Hope, a container gardening project that uses growing one's own food as a grassroots community mobilizer for food security, sovereignty and justice. Rhody Grows Hope project encompasses various CC4ES projects whose common thread is gardening: Museum of Silenced Histories, Youths for Urban Sustainability, and CC4ES Direct all through Hope Gardeners network platform. They reflect Susan's belief food justice is a gateway to environmental, social and economic justice, and resonate with her commitment to and passion for cultivating communities that honor and value justice and equity. 

      Susan holds B.S.and M.S.in chemistry and a dual ABD in chemistry and education system designs with focus on innercity communities and their schools, and a Ph.D. in environmental and natural resource economics.

      Diana Ferreira began her trajectory in the education sector over 7 years ago after being in the costume jewelry industry for almost 20 years. She is a daughter, partner, mother and grandmother to some of the most amazing human beings on this planet, immigrating to Rhode Island at a young age from Colombia, South America.

      Diana believes in the importance and value of raising not only academically bright, but also kind, respectful, socially conscious and responsible children in this world. She considers herself a fierce advocate for those that may be faced with the English language as a barrier, or just lack of knowledge to help themselves or their families succeed and have as many choices and opportunities the world has to offer. She sees the need for more people to work towards a goal where everyone has equitable opportunities to reach their highest potential and become contributing members of our communities and beyond. Which is why working in education is a pathway to reach many that need it most in the hopes of making an impact on their lives.

      Diana worked in public education for seven years and is passionate about helping bridge the language barrier for Spanish-speaking Rhode Islanders and beyond to promote knowledge, information, and education in various topics and on various levels to promote informed decisions and more active participation, leading to positive change for underserved minority populations.  Joining the Coalition Center for Environmental Sustainability was an easy decision because CC4ES brings a wealth of knowledge and education that can only further catapult the impact she is trying to make in her community.

Acting as the Northeast Regional Organizer, Chris oversaw eleven states (including D.C) and the five thousand volunteer leaders in that region, coordinating with volunteers to address underlying conditions that have disenfranchised their communities, stewarding leaders toward continued local investment.

      Alex Gorelick spent most of his early life in Rhode Island. After graduating from the University of Rhode Island in 2014,  he spent a year and a half exploring various cultures of India, South Korea, and Japan, primarily through work-exchange arrangements through the Workaway and WWOOF platforms. 
      
      Spending a few weeks to a few months with different hosts, he volunteered at organic farms, guest houses, language exchange cafes, and more. Through these experiences he learned about regenerative agriculture and permaculture, but he also came to appreciate the different lifestyles of the kind people who hosted him. They also reframe his view of ways of living outside of the capital-focused lens that is predominant in mainstream American culture. Supporting himself to explore abroad, he became an English language teacher in Seoul, South Korea where he lived and worked for five years. 
      
      Alex hopes to apply the perspective and skills he acquired to help himself and his community members pursue health, happiness, and political and social transformations that align with the CC4ES’ mission.

      Financial Literacy Specialist for Transformative Justice

    bioText: |
      Delve into the remarkable life of Dr. Gavin Adams, a NYC native who was born and raised in the Chelsea section of Manhattan, is the oldest of 7 and a father of two lovely daughters. Gavin’s academic pursuits reflect his commitment to serving lower socioeconomic communities and addressing societal challenges. He is an educator with over 15 years of experience within both urban and suburban school districts and is an avid believer that living is learning. His dedication and passion for financial literacy extends far beyond the classroom.  As a visionary, he founded a family-run real estate firm with property located in New York, Connecticut and Rhode Island. 

      His professional trajectory resulting in passion for teaching students and coaching teachers has also led him to a career in school leadership and experience as an adjunct professor on the collegiate level. As a first-born American and first-generation college graduate, he has passionately dedicated himself to bridging the education and economic gap within lower socioeconomic communities through academic based experiences. 

      Gavin found education to be a saving grace. As a ward of the court, street orphan, he vowed to himself that as an adult he would never allow himself or any relatives to become homeless. His tenure as a New York City school teacher enabled him to successfully establish a Real Estate portfolio and pay it forward by creating a business that allowed him to provide employment for a number of relatives. 

      He is driven by a vision to ensure the individuals he comes into contact with have access to high-quality financial education to increase the likelihood of better financial outcomes as adults that result in a very comfortable and high quality of life.  Gavin is also an avid believer that people like to learn from those who they like and those who have accomplished what they are teaching. Today, while he is still an active school leader, he finds joy in sharing his life story with students who come from the same background and who may have to overcome very similar obstacles to those he encountered. 

      Gavin’s strong connection to the mission of CC4ES is a result of his upbringing and a desire to improve the financial and physical health of impoverished communities through education, which he is a fond believer of it being the only way to level the unbalanced playing field. As a person who experienced food insecurity, he remembers the days where he was grateful to have eaten school lunch, because he would not have dinner that night. Instead, he would save money from his after-school job and prepare for unforeseeable events, which as a teenager was his first experience with sustaining economic stability. Through his passion for financial literacy, his goal is to transfer a skillset that will champion equity and justice to all students within CC4ES' school community and collaborative partners.
