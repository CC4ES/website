These huge stones produce the exceptional texture and quality not found in modern, steel ground flours.  Genuine, single pass stone grinding also preserves the vital, natural nutrition of the grains.  Kenyon’s offers the ingredients that health conscious consumers are searching for - ground the simple, old-fashioned way of long ago.

Using the most up-to date information from recent research and creative interaction with the public in a variety of ways & venues, TIP will seek and disseminate knowledge on how to avoid the worst toxics and to embrace safer ways to live our everyday lives.\nTIP will promote the sale of effective & less toxic alternative products.\nTIP will facilitate people’s sharing of their personal experiences with reactions to chemicals. TIP will provide ways to exchange information about less toxic products that have proven effective in actual use.\nTIP will also provoke people to think about environmental effects from the residue in streams and soil and air from both manufacture of these products and their disposal after use by consumers."
