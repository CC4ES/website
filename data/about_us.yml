      which she hopes to bring to schools as well. In early 2020, she brought indoor
      garden racks to three Providence middle schools from Sodexo and experienced planting
      and harvesting herbs and lettuces with the students. Now, she is planning to work with
      youth to build a school garden at Hope High School in partnership with the Comprehensive
