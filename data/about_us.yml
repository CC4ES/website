      Susan is a perpetual learner and a quintessential educator with 30 plus years 
      of teaching, mostly in universities. Her pursuit in interdisciplinary teaching in a 
      diverse range of student demographics started with her life-defining experiences 
      as a 15 year-old Korean immigrant in Flatbush, Brooklyn, New York.  This gave rise, 
      in her adult life, to a specific focus on frontline communities and a passion for, 
      and commitment to building a community-narrated and empowered sustainable and 
      regenerative society that champions environmental, economic and social justice 
      and equity. 
      
      Susan founded the Coalition Center for Environmental Sustainability/ Cc4ES, based on 
      the core tenets from her consistent practice as a perpetual learner: a holistic approach, 
      internal motivation, and building a network environment for lifelong learning. Cc4ES 
      was founded to serve as an interface bridging information and resource gaps between 
      policy makers and communities in need. Through both her teaching and her community-based 
      work, Susan works to develop strong engagement between academia and surrounding communities 
      through process of outreach education, and spearheading opportunities for universities 
      to collaborate with policy makers and businesses in supporting community-focused economic 
      development. 
      
      Having volunteered as a Master Gardener to oversee the Providence schools under the URI 
      Cooperative Extension School Garden Initiative program, Susan created the Hope Gardeners, 
      a comprehensive gardeners network platform to complement its mission and to expand its outreach 
      to community gardeners and college campus gardeners. Hope Gardeners provides an integral collaboration forum 
      necessary for all Cc4ES programs.
      
      She launched Rhody Grows Hope, a container gardening project that uses growing own food as 
      a grassroots community mobilizer for food security, sovereignty and justice. Rhody Grows Hope 
      project encompasses various Cc4ES projects whose common thread is gardening: Museum of 
      Silenced Histories & Garden of Regeneration, Youths for Urban Sustainability program for Rhody Greeneers, 
      and Cc4ES Direct all through Hope Gardeners network platform. They reflect Susan's belief food justice 
      is a gateway to environmental, social and economic justice, and resonate with her commitment to and 
      passion for cultivating communities that honor and value justice and equity. 
      
      Susan holds B.S.and M.S.in chemistry and a dual ABD in chemistry and education system designs with focus on innercity 
      communities and their schools, and a Ph.D. in environmental and natural resource economics.

      Diana Ferreira began her trajectory in the education sector over 7 years ago after being in the costume jewelry industry for almost 20 years. 
      She is a daughter, partner, mother and grandmother to some of the most amazing human beings on this planet, immigrating to Rhode Island at a young age from
      Colombia, South America.
      
      Diana believes in the importance and value of raising not only academically bright, 
      but also kind, respectful, socially conscious and responsible children in this world. 
      She considers herself a fierce advocate for those that may be faced with the English language as a barrier, 
      or just lack of knowledge to help themselves or their families succeed and have as many choices 
      and opportunities the world has to offer. She sees the need for more people to
      work towards a goal where everyone has equitable opportunities to reach their highest potential 
      and become contributing members of our communities and beyond. Which is why working in education is a pathway 
      to reach many that need it most in the hopes of making an impact on their lives.

      Diana is currently the Operations Associate at Nuestro Mundo Public Charter School located in South Providence, RI. 
      Nuestro Mundo is a dual language public charter school that also has a focus on teaching its students 
      about Global Sustainability and to be stewards for the environment so that we may have a sustainable planet 
      for many generations to come to which joining the Coalition Center for Environmental Sustainability was an easy decision
      because the CCES brings a wealth of knowledge and education that can only further catapult the impact she is trying to make in her community.

      Marissa’s passion for the environment was sparked by the book “You Are Here”, 
      bringing an awareness of the impact of human activity on the environment. This 
      book also     introduced her to the problem known as “the great pacific garbage 
      patch”. Marissa’s love of the ocean and interest to join the efforts to protect 
      the oceans, led her to volunteer with Surfrider Foundation. She served on 
      Surfriders’ Executive Board in the Rhode Island and Los Angeles chapters for 
      many years.
      
      Marissa’s vision led her to create a retail business, The Kind Shop, with a 
      mission of helping to preserve our beautiful planet. The Kind Shop provides 
      access to plastic-free, natural and sustainable products while educating and 
      inspiring the local community. One of the goals of the organization is to 
      create a community and offer educational, creative workshops and classes.
