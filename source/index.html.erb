      <h2><strong>A Web-Based Center That Cultivates<br>Sustainable Lifestyle In All Walks Of Life</strong></h2>
      <p>Ever emerging environmental, social and economic challenges necessitate a lifestyle that fosters sustainability. 
        Cultivation of a sustainable lifestyle entails continual learning and diligent practices. Such endeavor resonates 
        with the CC4ES core tenets: comprehensive collaboration for systemic changes, community-based and empowered motivation, 
        and establishing an environment for lifelong learning and practice.</p> 
      
      <p>Food is a universal human right. Because we as food eaters form the largest common denominator, food underscores the 
        commonality among us.  As food is embedded in socio-cultural systems, food justice is environmental, social and economic 
        justice. Growing one's own food provides the most direct impactful means of ensuring environmental, social and economic sustainability.
        CC4ES uses growing one's own food as a grassroots community mobilizer to platform collective shifts necessary for cultivating 
        community-narrated and empowered regenerative sustainability.</p>
      
      <h4>Aligning with its core tenets, CC4ES WebCenter is organized in LEARN-CONNECT-PRACTICE infrastructure for Rhody Grows Hope project

      <p>Rhody Grows Hope (RGH) is a container gardening program that repurposes food plastic recyclables - such as 32-oz yogurt containers and salad containers - as planters to grow food while reducing plastic waste.  RGH also repurposes heat-treated pallets as raised garden beds. <br/><br/>RGH circumvents soil contamination and limited or no land access prevalent in frontline communities, for food security, sovereignty and justice. <br/><br/>Every $20 provides a RGH garden to help a family in need.</p>
