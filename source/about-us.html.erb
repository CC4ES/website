      <h2>Mission of CC4ES:</h2>
      <p class="big-text">
      To link resources with communities in need for building community member-narrated and led regenerative environmental, social and economic sustainability that champions justice and equity.
      
      <p class="cell small-12"> 
      Building a community that champions justice and equity in the intersection of environmental, social and economic sustainability requires collaboration necessary for collective shifts.  Such shifts must start with awareness and continual practice at individual levels, cascading to collective levels.  CC4ES links organizations in collaboration with communities for the shared projects.  Yet, CC4ES does not consolidate nor represent them.  Instead, CC4ES identifies each collaborating partnerâ€™s needs and resources to underscore their missions, helping them realize their outcomes.  This approach is practiced within the CC4ES Team.  CC4ES Team is categorized as Board Members, Collaborators, Advisors and Participants based on the level of their involvement.

      <p class="cell small-12">
        CC4ES Team Members research, consult, advise, mentor, design programs and curricula, lead or collaborate for projects or initiatives in various capacities and institution types from businesses, academia, and community organizations.  Our projects also vary in sizes from creating a pollinator garden to a state-wide program.  We seek our own funding as well as help organizations we partner with find funds -- assist them with or partnering for research and writing grants and more.
