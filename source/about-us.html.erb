      <h2>Mission of CC4ES:</h2>
      <p class="big-text">
        to build sustainable and resilient communities with environmental, social and economic justice and equity.
      </p>
      <p class="cell small-12">
        The meaning of “Environmental Sustainability” varies depending upon the context.  Sustainability encompasses three essential components -- environmental (Planet), social (People) and economic (Prosperity or Profit).  Environment can be a community of social interactions, a political system, a natural ecosystem, a business entity of economic interactions, or society as a whole. 
      </p>
      <p class="cell small-12"> 
        Building a community or society that champions justice and equity in all environmental, social and economic sustainability dimensions requires collaboration necessary for collective shifts.  Although such shifts must start with awareness and continual practice of justice and equity at the individual level, individuals and organizations need to come out of our own institutionalized silos.  CC4ES’ mission is to link the entities of any size and shape through collaboration, but does not consolidate them.  Instead, CC4ES identifies each entity's needs and resources to showcase their outcomes. This approach is practiced within the CC4ES team.  Each of these team members voluntarily brings in their expertise and assets to the team so that we can pass on the sinergy transpired from our collaboration.
