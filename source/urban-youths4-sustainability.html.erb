      <p>Food system brings universal common humanity in all of us because we as “food eaters” make the largest common denominator.  Food system provides a most direct means of shifting toward sustainability.  Food systems intersect all three dimensions of sustainability.  By underscoring the common threads between sustainability and food systems for its core guiding principles, UYS provides a pipeline that other related programs can build and showcase their specialty upon. Accordingly, UYS outcomes are community-centered, narrated by members, mobilizing social norms to build a community its members identify with and to stay with.</p>
      <p>Urban Youths for Sustainability (UYS) is a youth core job training program for urban youths for 14-24 years old. Its focus on growing own food and environmental stewardship directly engages community youths to tackle the persistent food insecurity and environmental pollutions in the urban communities, along with job insecurity.</p>
      <p>UYS platforms an accreditation infrastructure that various organizations with the common causes can base to develop or modify to their respectively specified outcomes. This cultivates community-based and initiated collaboration for continual learning necessary in building sustainable communities resilient with social, environmental, and economic justice equity.</p>
      <p>The outcomes of such core sustainability program from pipelining the established and emerging state-wide youth programs are:</p> 
      <ul>
        <li>Aligns with state department of education’s STEM benchmarks to be integrated into local education agencies (LEA), urban public school systems in particular.  This would give incentive for youths to complete their education and hold school systems accountable.</li>
        <li>Platforms accredited career development paths for post-secondary continual/reskill learning and job opportunities pertinent to such trainings.</li>
      </ul>
