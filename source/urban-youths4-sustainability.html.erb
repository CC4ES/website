      <p>Urban Youths for Sustainability (UYS) is a youth core job training program for urban youths for 14-24 years old. Its focus on growing own food and environmental stewardship directly engages community youths to tackle the persistent food insecurity and environmental pollutions in the urban communities, along with job insecurity.</p>
      <p>UYS platforms an accreditation infrastructure that various organizations with the common causes can base to develop or modify to their respectively specified outcomes. This cultivates community-based and initiated collaboration for continual learning necessary in building sustainable communities resilient with social, environmental, and economic justice equity.</p>
      <p></p>
      <p>Its accompanying community-convening space includes: 
      <ul>
        <li>spaces for in-person meetings and events</li>
        <li>a reading room and library holding history and knowledge recorded orally, visually and in writings by members of the target communities, as well as books and digital resources focusing on issues these communities face</li>
        <li>a street-facing gallery (matched by an online version) celebrating the rich and diverse creativity of these communities, especially as it articulates their histories, their journeys through space and time, and their relationships with the land as reflected in their food, clay, and fiber traditions.</li>
        <li>a quiet space for personal or group reflection and meditation</li>
        <li>a garden-centered green space as a site of healing, hope and nurturance within parameters designed by nature</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class='text-center'>Garden of Regeneration</h3>
      <p>Gardens as institutions have stood as sites of healing, hope, and nurturance because they reflect gardeners' paradigms within the parameters designed by nature.</p>
      <p>The MSH Garden of Regeneration is a verdant space where those whose voices have been silenced can openly and freely reflect, value, and honor their own cultural knowledge and wisdom.</p>
      <p>The garden serves as an urban wildlife habitat, a place for cultivating environmental stewardship, and as an incubator of regenerative agriculture approaches and knowledge that re-establishes our bonds with the land. At the same time, it joins with the existing community gardens in the area and related community land stewardship initiatives in offering a model of environmental sustainability to surrounding neighborhoods and the region.</p>
